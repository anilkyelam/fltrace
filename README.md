# fltrace




#### Requirements
- Linux kernel 5.9 or higher (recently tested on 5.15)
- [jemalloc](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc)
    ```
    ./deps.sh --force   # sets up jemalloc libs
    ```

#### Build
```
make clean
make

# if needed, set the following flags
make DEBUG=1      # run with (very) verbose logging
make SAFEMODE=1   # run with a bunch of safety checks
```

#### Run
```
env="LD_PRELOAD=./fltrace.so"               # the tool is an LD_PRELOADable library
env="$env FLTRACE_MAX_MEMORY_MB=10000"      # max memory the app would need (in MB)
env="$env FLTRACE_LOCAL_MEMORY_MB=1000"     # memory (in MB) that app has "locally"
env="$env FLTRACE_NHANDLERS=1"              # number of cores to run on (default: 1). 
                                            # More cores == faster tracing, but each core would output a separate trace file
env="$env FLTRACE_MAX_SAMPLES_PER_SEC=0"    # max samples per sec (default: 0, i.e., trace all faults)

$env <app> <app args>                       # run the app with the tool
```
